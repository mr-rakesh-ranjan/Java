/*
 Types of Binary Tree
 1. Complete Binary tree - every level except the last one is completely filled. Ex - Binary Heap
 2. Fully/Strictly binary tree - In which each nodes has exactly 0 or 2 children. 
 3. perfect binary tree - It is type of full binary tree which each internal nodes has exactly two child nodes.
 4. Right Skew binary tree - In which either each node has a right child or no child.
 5. Left skew binary tree - In which each node has a left child or no child.
 6. Height-balanced binary tree - a binary tree such that the left & the right subtree for any given node differs in height by max one. Ex- AVL tree and RB tree
 
 Note- Each complete binary is a height-balanced binary tree.
